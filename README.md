Description: An alteration to a pre-existing [program](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/microbit-breakout-board-hookup-guide) which allows the led matrix of the microbit to be active while the analog pins are being used.

Description: A revision to my screen saver [program](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/screensavers-for-the-micro-bit-O11WL1D/blob/master/screen_savers.js) where the multiples of screen saver also detects if the currently evaluated number is odd, even or a prime factor, sending a digital high to pin zero, one or two, to light up 3 leds.

Description: A program for the bbc microbit which reads analog signals from an external moisture sensor and lights up a corresponding pattern using the 5x5 led matrix.

Description: A revision to the manual-calibration program which allows the user to calibrate the pattern to value map via taking max and min measurements. Upon it's start, the program will prompt the user to take a minimum moisture measurement by displaying an arrow pointing downwards on the 5x5 led matrix. After the user has positioned the sensor in an area of minimal moisture, pressing the a button will save that value and prompt for a max measurement. After a series of measurements have been recorded, the program will calibrate the pattern map and then behave in a manner identical to the manual-calibration program.
